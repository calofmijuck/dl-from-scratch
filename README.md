# Deep Learning from Scratch

This project is an implementation of a neural network only with `numpy`, without using other deep learning frameworks such as `tensorflow` or `pytorch`.

The book [Deep Learning from Scratch](https://www.hanbit.co.kr/media/community/review_view.html?hbr_idx=3595) was used for reference.

## Contents

Chapter 1 was introduction to Python, and thus was omitted.

Chapter 2 through 7 is about implementing CNNs.
